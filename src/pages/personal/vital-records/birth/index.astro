  heroIntro: "Sponsoring a child in the UAE requires more than just a translated birth certificate. It requires a document that authorities will actually accept. We review every submission before accepting payment, checking for the stamps, attestations, and formatting that ICP, GDRFA, and Golden Visa processing centres look for. This helps reduce the risk of rejection notices that can delay family reunification.",

      question: "Can I use a photo from my phone for birth certificate translation?",
      answer: "Yes, you can submit a clear photo taken with your phone. The key requirements are: all four corners of the document must be visible, the text must be legible without blur, and any stamps or seals should be clearly captured. We will review your submission and let you know immediately if a clearer image is needed before proceeding."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this birth certificate translation accepted for Golden Visa applications?",
      answer: "Yes. Our MOJ-certified birth certificate translations are accepted by ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security) for Golden Visa applications. The translation includes the official stamp, QR code verification, and translator license details required for all Golden Visa family sponsorship documentation."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you deliver translated birth certificates to Abu Dhabi?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide next-day courier delivery to Abu Dhabi and all other Emirates. For urgent cases, same-day delivery to Abu Dhabi can be arranged through our express courier partners. Digital copies are sent immediately upon completion regardless of your location."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my birth certificate is from another country?",
      answer: "We translate birth certificates from virtually any country and language. For documents in languages other than English, we may use a two-step process (original language to English, then English to Arabic) if required. Documents from most countries need MOFA attestation before translation for UAE government use."
    },
    {
      question: "Does my birth certificate need MOFA attestation before translation?",
      answer: "It depends on the intended use. For GDRFA visa sponsorship and Golden Visa applications, the birth certificate typically needs to be attested by your home country's authorities, your home country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the UAE Embassy in your home country, and UAE MOFA. We review each case individually and advise you before you spend money on translation that may not serve its purpose."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does birth certificate translation take?",
      answer: "Standard service delivers within 24 hours. Express service completes in 6 hours with priority handling. VIP Concierge provides 1-hour drafts with immediate agent assignment. All timelines begin after document review and payment confirmation."
